# Revision Notes for Updated End-to-End Energy Boxplot Figure

This document summarizes the required adjustments for refining the improved end-to-end energy comparison figure. These refinements focus on scientific clarity, visual professionalism, and SCI/MDPI publication standards.

---

## 1. Mean Value Labels (44.2 and 46.2)
- The numbers should explicitly include **units**:  
  - `44.2 kJ` instead of `44.2`  
  - `46.2 kJ` instead of `46.2`
- Move the labels slightly **downward** so they sit:
  - Just **above the box**, not near the whisker.
- Font size should be **smaller and subtle**, avoiding competition with main plot elements.

---

## 2. Positioning of Mean Markers
- The white diamond markers are appropriate.
- Ensure the marker and text label do not overlap the median line or whiskers.

---

## 3. Boxplot Styling
- The current rectangular boxplot style is correct and professional.
- Maintain consistent transparency and muted colors.

---

## 4. X-Axis Labels ("Proposed Framework" and "Baseline Method")
- Both are acceptable, but consistency with terminology used in the paper is essential.
- Recommended:  
  - **Proposed Framework**  
  - **Baseline Strategy**
- Ensure all figures and manuscript sections use the **same naming scheme**.

---

## 5. Y-Axis Units
- Using **kJ** is correct and improves readability.
- Ensure all values across plots use the same unit notation (e.g., “kJ”).

---

## 6. Optional—but Recommended—Annotation
- Consider adding a **small, subtle annotation** showing energy reduction, e.g.:
  - `Energy reduction: 9.2%`
- Place this in the **upper-right corner** in small grey text.
- Avoid large boxes, bright colors, or borders.

---

## 7. Overall Visual Professionalism
- Ensure all font sizes match the style used in other figures.
- Keep the layout clean, minimal, and consistent.
- Avoid heavy lines or thick whiskers.

---

## 8. Caption Guidelines
A suitable caption might be:

```
Figure X. End-to-end system energy consumption under the proposed framework and the baseline strategy.
Each box summarizes N randomized simulation runs, with diamond markers indicating the mean.
The proposed method achieves a 9.2% reduction in total mission energy compared with the baseline.
```

---

## 9. Final Goal
After applying the revisions, the figure should:
- Present statistically meaningful comparison.
- Match the professional visual tone of SCI/MDPI publications.
- Clearly communicate end-to-end performance improvements.
- Align terminology and formatting across the entire manuscript.
